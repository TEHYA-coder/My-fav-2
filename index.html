            <p id="para1">Bellatrix Lestrange (nee black) is my favourite charecter. She is from the fantasy novel collection of Harry Potter by Joanne Kathleen Rowling. Actually Bellatrix is a villain but her looks and power is what I like about her. Here is some information abput her:
                <br> <br>
                Bellatrix was born in 1951 to Cygnus Black III and Druella Rosier, who gave her a rich lifestyle and raised her to be proud of her pure-blood heritage. She was the elder sister of Andromeda Black (Tonks) and Narcissa Black (Malfoy). Bellatrix attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Slytherin House, a patron followed by her sisters. Along with the rest of her family who held pureblood supremacy beliefs, Bellatrix cut off contact with Andromeda when she married Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks, causing her to be disowned from the House of Black. Neither she or Narcissa had "set eyes on Andromeda since she married the Mudblood Tonks". She also held her cousin Sirius Black in contempt for being a "blood traitor" due his different opinions on Muggles and Muggle-borns. Bellatrix eventually married Rodolphus Lestrange, a fellow wealthy pure-blood and Slytherin, marrying out of obligation of fulfilling her familyâ€™s pro pure-blood mentality and tradition, Unlike her sisters, she never displayed any affection for her husband whatsoever, never even mentioning him in conversations nor bearing him any children. When Lord Voldemort first rose to power, Bellatrix and Rodolphus joined the Death Eaters.
